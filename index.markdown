# Introduction to SPARQL #

[SPARQL][] is the query language for [RDF][] data in the way that SQL is the query language for traditional relational databases. This tutorial covers basic [SPARQL][] syntax as well as how to practically query local and remote [RDF][] data using the platform-independent [ARQ-home][] toolkit.
